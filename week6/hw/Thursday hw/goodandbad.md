"Brand New" is a website that primarily showcases and evaluates new logos for various brands, including in-depth analysis of new designs and comparisons before and after design. It made and built the clear comparision between the "before and after" logo design. The classification of brand categories and design styles can also improve the user experience for visitors and enable them to quickly find the "brand new" they are looking for.

This is Jessica Hische's personal website, and I really like it. I  discovered the clever design of "Jessica's Client Email Helper" on this website. By selecting the client and budget, the client can receive sincere responses set by the artist, and there is even a category called friend. I think this design is very cute and saves time for both parties.

I think it is a little bit chaotic and hard to find the category her clients want to see. Only listing the projects she made seems a lit bit hard to locate the important message people want to find from this website.
